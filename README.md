#  C2-Source-Cheat-CSharp
This is a cheat source made in C# completely external for CS2, the content is entirely educational for the purpose of learning.

# ü™¨ Dependencies for operation:
- Visual Studio 2022
- Console application dependencies in C# in Visual Studio 2022 (I think that when you open the project everything will be fine, if not, install it through the Microsoft Installer.)
- DotNET: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.203-windows-x64-installer
- And microsoft frameworks (2005 > 2022) (Search on Google)

# üß† Questions:
### How to update the offsets?
- Access the "offsets.cs" class and check if everything is updated according to https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper
- To perform this check, visit the above website, go to generated, and verify the offsets according to the comments in offsets.cs

### Can I get banned for this? ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Of course, Valve is a multimillion-dollar company and updating and fixing this is very quick. Well, as of the time of this publication, everything is working perfectly on servers protected by VAC, but as I mentioned before, Valve has enough resources to detect it, so, use at your own risk.

- Remember, this code was made for study purposes, for you to see how it works behind an external cheat and maybe unlock your mind for other things, not just for cheating obviously.

### Will you keep this GitHub updated?
- No, I will not update this GitHub. However, I've already provided the link above in case you want to keep updating your cheat.

### How do I use this?
- You need to download dotnet 8.0 which is available at the beginning of this readme and install it on your computer.
- Remember, your CS2 needs to be in full-screen windowed mode and at the resolution 1920x1080, but this resolution can be changed in the source code. Just access Renderer.cs and look for this resolution to edit.
